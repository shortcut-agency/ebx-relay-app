## Create a local installer of the app

- Pull the main branch, run `npm install` then `npm run dist`. The installer should be in the dist directory

## Deploy a new version of the app to the end users

- Make sure to change the version in the package.json to a higher version.
- Run `GH_TOKEN=<YOUR GITHUB TOKEN> npm run publish` in console
- A new draft release should be added on the repository. Be careful to not change the release tag since it is automatically generated by electron-updater. Change the update log fields then publish the release
- The end users should have a notification on the next launch of the app
